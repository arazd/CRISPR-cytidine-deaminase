# gRNA designer for CRISPR cytidine deaminase

This repository contains open-source tools for gRNA design for CRISPR cytidine deaminase.

## Biology overview
### CRISPR-Cas9
CRISPR-Cas9 is a molecular system that can target specific DNA sequences and make cuts, allowing to perform genome editing by "turning off" some genes. 

CRISPR stands for <i>clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats</i> - short DNA sequences originally found in bacteria, which serve as bacterial immune system and participate in anti-viral defence [1]. In bacterial cell these sequences are transcribed into short RNA sequences that guide the CRISPR-Cas9 system to matching sequences of DNA of the invading virus. Once target DNA is found, protein Cas9 performs a cut and blocks a target gene. This mechanism of defence allows bacteria to protect against viruses by turning off their important genes and, hence, killing the virus.

## CRISPR as genome editing tool
In 2013 the first CRISPR system was engineered to perform genome editing in mouse and human cells [2]. After that, the system became widely used in biomedical laboratories across the world as a genome editing tool.

The principle behing genome editing with CRISPR is "find and edit". Cas9 protein is matched with a specifically engineered **guide RNA** (or gRNA) that allows the system to find a DNA sequence that we want to edit. After complementary DNA is found, Cas9 protein cuts it. Instead of using Cas9, we can also use other DNA-editing proteins (like Cytidine deaminase).
